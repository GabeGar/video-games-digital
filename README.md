## Overview

### The challenge

-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page where applicable.
-   Navigate to the different incorporated pages of the app such as the Home, Store, StoreItem and Cart pages.
-   Search for games based on genres pre-defined in the RAWG api.
-   Search for specific games by typing a query into the input form element.
-   Click on game image banner and proceed to view details for clicked game.

## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React library
-   [Redux-TK](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs) - Api
-   FlexBox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Redux Toolkit
-   Learned quite a bit about redux toolkit and it seems as though I've only scratched the surface. It was definitely intimidating at first but with the time spent on this project, I've definitely come out a stronger developer for it. At least, in my opinion.
-   Handling state management with slices was very intuitive as it made handling state across the application, practically a breeze. The devtools for troubleshooting actions and state (redux devtools) was very easy to follow and learn.
